## Backend Setup (CarDexBackend)

### ðŸ§© Prerequisites
  - [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (v8.0.414)
  - Git
  - Optional: Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

Check installation:
  ```
  dotnet --version
  ```
  
  Clone and restore dependencies:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/VSHAH1210/CarDex.git
  cd CarDexBackend
  dotnet restores
  ```

  Build all projects:
  ```
  dotnet build
  ```

### Running the Web API

From the project root:

```
dotnet run --project CarDexBackend/CarDexBackend.Api
```

Once running, visit:

  http://localhost:5083/swagger

Swagger will list all the controllers (Auth, Cards, Collections,   Packs, Trades, Users).

### Running Tests
From the project root,

Run all unit tests across the backend layer:
```
dotnet test
```

### Running Tests with Coverage (Coverlet)
From the project root,

Run tests and collect coverage:
```
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

Generate an HTML report:
```
reportgenerator -reports:"**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html
```

Open the report in your browser:
```
start coveragereport/index.html
```

## AI Disclaimer

Portions of this project were developed with assistance from OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT.
Specifically, AI assistance was used to:

- Format XML documentation comments for controllers and DTOs.

- Provide mock service structure and test case suggestions for the unit tests.
