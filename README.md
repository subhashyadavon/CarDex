Players can:
- Open randomized packs of car cards with unique stats and rarities  
- Trade cards with other players

- Race cars based on their performance stats  
- Upgrade and customize their garage

## Backend Setup (CarDexBackend)

### ðŸ§© Prerequisites
  - [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) (v8.0.414)
  - reportgenerator (dotnet tool)
  - Git
  - Optional: Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code  
</br>

```bash
# Check installation
dotnet --version

# Check reportgenerator tool, this should show 'dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool' installed
dotnet tool list --global
# (If not installed) run this command to install the tool
dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool

# Clone and restore dependencies
git clone https://github.com/VSHAH1210/CarDex.git
cd CarDexBackend
dotnet restore

# Build all projects
dotnet build
```

### Run: Web API

```bash
# From the project root
dotnet run --project CarDexBackend/CarDexBackend.Api

# Once running, visit the swagger to see all the controllers
# (Auth, Cards, Collections,   Packs, Trades, Users)
http://localhost:5083/swagger
```

### Run: Tests

#### NORMAL
```bash
# From the project root
# This runs all unit tests across the backend layer
dotnet test
```

#### WITH COVERAGE (COVERLET)
```bash
# From the project root
# Runs tests and collects coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Generate an HTML report, ensure you followed the tool install steps in the setup steps
reportgenerator -reports:"**/coverage.cobertura.xml" -targetdir:"coveragereport" -reporttypes:Html

# Open the report in your browser (Windows)
# You can also just simply open the index.html file
start coveragereport/index.html
```

</br>

## Frontend Setup
At the current moment, we just have the TradingEngine as a Frontend component written.  
It will be used as a baseline for the rest of the logic engines, including their tests.

### ðŸ§© Prerequisites
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.0 or higher)
  - npm (comes with Node.js)
  - Optional: VS Code with TypeScript extensions


```bash
# Check installation
node --version
npm --version

# Clone
git clone https://github.com/VSHAH1210/CarDex.git
cd CarDexFrontend
```

### Run: Tests
Ensure you are in the directory `/CarDexFrontend`.  
> **NOTE: On windows you may need to be in administrator mode to run the tests. Using cmd does not require that.**  

#### NORMAL (WITHOUT WATCH MODE)
```bash
# While in /CarDexFrontend
npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

#### WITH COVERAGE 
```bash
# While in /CarDexFrontend
# The coverage report will be generated in `/CarDexFrontend/coverage/lcov-report`
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# Open the report in your browser (Windows)
# You can also just simply open the index.html file
start coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

## AI Disclaimer

Portions of this project were developed with assistance from OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT.
Specifically, AI assistance was used to:

- Format XML documentation comments for controllers and DTOs.
- Provide mock service structure and test case suggestions for the unit tests.
- Helping with writing documentation markdown (md) files.
